# Status

- Current plan: Plan A+ – Custom GPT distribution and release automation
- Plan A completion marker: A1–A30 / A30
- Completed: A1–A39 / A30 + A31 + A32 + A33 + A34 + A35 + A36 + A37 + A38 + A39
- Current version: 0.1.0-dev.39
- Milestone: **Plan A complete; regression tests are isolated from CI event version context**
- Next: run the hosted workflow again and publish/re-run a GitHub Release to verify release assets under A39 isolation.

## A36 result

GitHub tag `vX.Y.Z` is authoritative for release distributions. The same resolved version is injected into Chat and Custom GPT package metadata and filenames. `VERSION` remains the development fallback.

## Source of truth

Canonical model/runtime sources remain unchanged. Release version authority is contextual: GitHub tag for tagged releases, `VERSION` otherwise.

## Repository cleanup after A36
A conservative cleanup removed superseded duplicate/generated artifacts while preserving active regression fixtures. The A23 duplicate example project and stored golden reference ZIP are no longer required; tests now validate the maintained reference project and deterministic packaging directly.


## A37 result

Pull requests run the full regression suite, pushes to `main` and manual runs additionally build/validate both distributions, and `release.published` builds and attaches Chat, Custom GPT and the build manifest to the GitHub Release. Only the release job receives `contents: write`.


## A38 result

Development distribution versions (`X.Y.Z-dev.N`) are now valid inputs to ZIP parity validation, while release/tag parsing remains strict (`vX.Y.Z` or `X.Y.Z`). This fixes the A36 hosted main-build failure without weakening release validation.


## A39 – Test environment isolation

Release/tag environment variables are now isolated from ordinary regression tests. Explicit version-context tests inject their own environment, so the same suite behaves identically on PR, main, workflow_dispatch and release.published jobs.
